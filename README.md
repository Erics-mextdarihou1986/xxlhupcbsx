Whoa... okay, I just stepped out of The Phoenician Scheme and honestly, my brain's still doing somersaults. You know that sound of rustling popcorn bags that somehow echoes through the whole theater? Yeah, that’s still playing in my ears, like some weird backtrack to all these thoughts jumbling around. I'm trying to put it all together but it’s like... like trying to rebuild a sandcastle during a windstorm. Scenes keep flashing in my head on repeat like a broken playlist on shuffle. Seriously, right from that opening chase scene — dude, with the boats speeding like they're late for the final 𝘦𝘱𝘪𝘴𝘰𝘥𝘦 of a reality show — whoa, my heart raced faster than I thought it could. Every turn a surprise, but isn't that what makes  s like this just pop?

> And there's this guy, what was his name again? It's like remembering a name when you need to fill out an awkward introduction card. Gabe? No, no, Grrr... why'd I think of grizzlies? He’s more like one of those smooth-talking classical painting dudes — but you know, holds a gun like it’s an accessory. And that sparkle of espionage! Critical as the burnt edges of my popcorn. Anyway, you really gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   to get it, words are just not cutting it. The plot twists like yoga poses my back definitely couldn’t manage. Like, did she triple-cross him? My mind’s officially mush.

And lord, my back is reminding me of all the sitting — not to mention, some kid two rows down decided opening candy wrappers was his call of the wild. The hustle, the betrayals – it’s like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 squirrels trying to stealth-snatch leftovers from a picnic blanket, except way more dangerous and minus the nuts.

— Pspsst, you can probably 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 too... If smudging truths with lies were Olympic sports, these characters just took gold. The last fifteen minutes? Pure madness, with flashes of - who did that reveal? Where did she even pull out that pendant from? And illusions, shadows... honestly, by the end I felt like I walked out of a blender.

Random thought: would've been cooler with maybe... llamas? Lightroom’s live ramp up, as plot deepens its claws, could keep it plausible. But it kept me riveted — a taut guitar string, vibrating.

Ah, this was meant to be a voice note, guess I got carried away. But anyway, it’s worth a shot, whether in theaters or you know, when you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Ok, hold up... OH, and the soundtrack! It’s like someone found all the moods and mixed them in a DJ’s witch cauldron. Kinda... groovy yet ominous.

    return pizza_toppings;

return NULL;

Ah crap, ignore that, got sidetracked with something else. Need coffee... or maybe just a nap.
